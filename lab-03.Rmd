### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```


Disrespects the people and the data by saying 1026 billion Chinese speakers, this is just blatantly wrong and misrepresents the data
Disrespects the mathematics as the bars aren't increasing proportionally to the number of speakers




## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

no scale, no label, not a proper pie-chart, cannot tell everything. not respect the people, data. hard to read. 




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

People are being disrespected by having no scales. Don't tell the difference in the size. No title, no key to tell what the colors mean. Disrespected the data by plotting too many points.




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

The y-axis is confusing, too much is going on in one image - disrespecting the people. 
Some groupings are not clear - who are the developed countries
The scale is confusing - its not linear and doesn't seem to be a correct log scale.



# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
long- rows are the observations and the columns are variable, one row per item
widy- rows are the variables and the columns are observations.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
its wide data, since its one row per faculty

How many observations are there in the data set?
there are five observations



## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>%
    pivot_longer(
    cols = "1975":"2011",
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here



```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

#staff_long <- staff_long %>%
#  mutate(year = ______(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
